# SkypeBot
A skype bot I threw together to help teach myself some Java. It's pretty poorly designed. This is my first major project. It's designed to work in a group chat. To use it, set the group chat you want to use as a "Favorite" in skype and only have that as a favorite. For a list of commands, type !commands in the group chat. Uses skype-java-api-1.6 and jsoup-1.8.2 libraries.

The biggest feature currently is the ability to search google or youtube in your skype group. The syntax for this is !google or !youtube followed by what you want to search.
