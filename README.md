# SkypeBot
A skype bot I threw together to help teach myself some Java. It's pretty poorly designed and a lot of the code I figured out by  googling so it's by no means completely my own work. It's designed to work in a group chat. To use it, set the group chat you want to use as a "Favorite" in skype and only have that as a favorite. It requires its own account and client if you want to be able to use its commands yourself. Others can use the commands just fine. For a list of commands, type !commands in the group chat. Uses skype-java-api-1.6 and jsoup-1.8.2 libraries.

It's biggest feature currently is it's ability to search google and post results into the group chat. 
The syntax for this is !google followed by the search you want to do.
